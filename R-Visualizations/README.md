# Iris Species Data Exploration 🌸

In this project, I performed an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the relationship between different Iris flower species measurements.

## 📊 Visual Result

* **Correlations**: High positive correlation (0.96) between Petal Length and Petal Width.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **R Language**
* **GGally (ggpairs)**
* **ggplot2**
