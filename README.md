# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate - Projects 🚀
This repository showcases my technical journey and projects completed during the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program. It demonstrates my skills in data analysis, visualization, and version control.

📊 Featured Project: Iris Species Data Exploration
In this project, I performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the classic Iris dataset using R.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
R Programming Language: For data manipulation and statistical analysis.

ggplot2: To create professional and clear visualizations.

GGally: To generate a generalized pairs plot for multivariate analysis.

Git & GitHub: For distributed version control and project documentation.
